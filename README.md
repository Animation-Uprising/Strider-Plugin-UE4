# Strider Is Now Free
I have decided to leave the game industry entirely and therefore have made strider free and public. Unfortuantely, as a result no support can be provided and there will likely be no future updates to this repository.

# Strider-Plugin-UE4/UE5
This is a private repository for verified users of the 'Strider Plugin' (UE4) to access, fork and create pull requests to the plugin source code.

# Installation
1. Close your project
2. Right click on your .uproject file and choose "Generate Visual Studio Project Files"
3. Clone the repository into your projects 'plugin' folder
4. Open your project and recompile (you will be asked to recompile before opening the project)
5. Enable the plugin in the UE4 editor and restart the editor when prompted
6. Depending on the version of UE4 you are using, you may need to modify the version in the .uplugin file within the plugin folder.
